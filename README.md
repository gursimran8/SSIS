# SSIS and MySQL Integration Project

This project demonstrates how to integrate SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) with MySQL for data migration and transformation tasks.

## Overview

In this project, we have integrated SSIS with MySQL to load data into a MySQL database from CSV files. The project covers the following tasks:
- Extracting data from CSV files.
- Loading data into a MySQL table.
- Verifying the loaded data.

## CSV File

The CSV file used for the data upload into the `employee` table is shown here:
